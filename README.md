# CardMatchingGame

<h2>Backstory</h2>
<div>
This project was made when i became a volunteer as an english teacher in Thailand. Back then, i got placed in a quite a rural area where the students have limited access to the newest technology. So i thought, why not make a game that not only fun for the students, but also educating. And here it is, let me present to you "Mix And Match".

Although it was made only with basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript without advanced framework like React or Nextjs, i think it can get the work done pretty well.</div>

<h2>Start Screen</h2>

The game meant to be run on a default web browser. For starters, there will be a deck of cards facing backwards, a time limit, and a counter of how many cards the player have flipped.
<h2>Gameplay</h2>

The gameplay based around matching 2 cards with the same image of Human Expression, there will also be a time limit of 120 seconds.
The player will be considered victory if they successfully match all the cards before the time runs out. If the player fails, the deck will be randomly organized and the game will restart.

<h2>User Experience</h2>

This project aims to develop intense focus for the player as well as getting familiar with Human Expressions (Hence why i put expressions as the front of the card). Although i don't have documentations for the real-life implementation of this program, i do have the photos of the users with their smiles.ðŸ˜„
