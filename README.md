# CardMatchingGame

<h2>Backstory</h2>
<div>
This project was made when i became a volunteer as an english teacher in Thailand. Back then, i got placed in a quite a rural area where the students have limited access to the newest technology. So i thought, why not make a game that not only fun for the students, but also educating. And here it is, let me present to you "A Card Matching Game". 
<br><br>
  
Although it was made only with basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript without advanced framework like React or Nextjs, i think it can get the work done pretty well.</div>
